# Operating-Systems - Device-Management

## Implemented the Device Management system of OSP2 simulation software using the CSCAN scheduling strategy
### The following statistics were calculated and resported for the implementation and compared with the default scheduling strategy which uses FIFO algorithm
* Total number of tracks swept on each device.
* Average number of tracks swept per I/O request.
* Average turnaround time for I/O requests.
* System throughput.


*University policy prohibits me from sharing the code online. However, the report (outlining the statistics) is linked and code is available on request.*
